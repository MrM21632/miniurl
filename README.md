# MiniURL: A TinyURL Clone

MiniURL is a basic clone of services like [TinyURL](https://tinyurl.com/app) and [Bit.ly](https://bitly.com/).
These services provide a means of "shortening" longer, more complex URLS into easier-to-remember and -reproduce
strings.

This project was done in part to practice concepts in system design and full-stack development.

More details to come soon.
